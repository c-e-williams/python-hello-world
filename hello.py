# Welcome, new coder.
# Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!'
# to the console (the panel on the right)

# print("Hello");
# print ("Hello World");
# print "Hello World"
# print ("Hello World)
# print (6)
# print (6+6)
# print ('coding is fun', 'launchcode is cool', 'I am sleepy')
# print  ('coding is fun')
# print ('launchcode is cool')
# print ('I am sleepy')


       
# print ('Quoth the Raven "Nevermore"')

# day = "Thursday"
# day = 32.5
# day = 19
# print(day)

# info = input("Please enter your age: ")
# # The user enters 25.

# print(type(info))
# int('3')
# int('three')

# Next, PLAY!
# Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

#   1. Change the message that is printed.
#   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them? 
#      No, the code doesn't work without the parenthesis. 
#   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
        # Yes we need to include quotation marks.  We can use single or double quotes; it doesn't matter which.
#   4. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
#   5. Print multiple messages one after the other.
#   6. Print two messages on the same line.
#   7. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
#   8. Other. You choose!
